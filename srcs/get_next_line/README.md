# get_next_line - 42 second programming project
This project helped developing knowledges on code organisation and deeper C and system understanding on how file read works (*file descriptors, one-way reading, static variables, etc)*.
Important notes to keep in mind while reading this project code:

 - This project works in an improvable way: i thought on many different ways of doing it, but all of them didn't successfully achieved the project goal
 - The previous project, [libft](https://github.com/Mariomm-marti/libft), was forbidden to use so I duplicated some functions from that project into this, changing `ft_strchr` so that it returns a count instead of an address

This project will be reviewed in a future, but as of now it is set as finished with the maximum possible score (115/100)
